%% Assignment 4 - Make your own EMG Processing Functions

% This week's assignment requires you to write three functions.

% When writing a function, the first questions should always be:
% What is the input? What is the output? What are the calculations in between?. 
% All three functions you will write should, of course, work for the tapping data we analysed above.
% Do not forget to comment every programming step in your function.

% Write the functions as separate m-files to test them, but, once you're ready to submit,
% copy the code in each of your three functions into this m-file 
% and upload ONLY this m-file (with your last and first name) to Moodle.

% Good luck!

% 1. Write the function 'preprocess_emg.m'. This function should perform the following standard preprocessing steps:
%    - removing offset
%    - filtering
%    - rectifying
%    - smoothing
%    Design the function such, that it can be used in other EMG experiments as well.

function [ output_args ] = Untitled2( input_args )

end

% 2. Write the function 'mvc_normalise_emg.m'. 
%    This function should perform amplitude normalisation based on MVC measurements.

function [ output_args ] = Untitled2( input_args )

end

% 3. Write the function 'time_normalise.m'.
%    This function should perform time normalisation on any data vector that you give it as input. 

function [ output_args ] = Untitled2( input_args )

% Please follow the instructions below by typing MATLAB code or MATLAB comments in this m-file.
% Subsequently, save the m-file in the format: 'Assignment_02_Yourlastname_Yourfirstname.m' 
% Finally, upload the assignment on Moodle. Good luck!

% 1. Present your solution to the randomwalk problem.

% 2. Directly below the download link for this m-file, there is a download-link to the function 'fernfast.m',
%    which is an adapted version of the original function 'fern.m'.
%
%    If you run both functions, you can see a clear difference in the speed with which the fern is created. 
%    Can you explain why fernfast creates the fern faster than the original function 'fern.m'?
%    Please refer to the actual MATLAB code of 'fernfast.m'.
%    For your convenience, I have indicated the code that is different from that in 'fern.m'.

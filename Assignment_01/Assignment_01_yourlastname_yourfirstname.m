% Please follow the instructions below by typing MATLAB code in this m-file.
% Subsequently, save the m-file in the format: 'Assignment_01_Yourlastname_Yourfirstname.m' 
% Finally, upload the assignment on Moodle. Good luck with (for many of you) your first MATLAB programming steps!

% If we were to create 10000 samples @ 2000Hz of a sine wave with amplitude 5m and frequency 20Hz,
% how many cycles of this sine wave would be in our sample? 


% Create the samples in the form of the variable 'signal'. Make liberal use (cut-paste) of the script 'Example_Problems.m', which you can find in Moodle.






% Add noise to the signal in the form of another sine wave with amplitude 1m and frequency 400Hz
% (Tip: First create the variable 'noise' containing only the noise-wave. Subsequently, add this noise to the original signal.)






% Perform a fast fourier transform of the signal and then plot the signal in the frequency domain.
% Can you recognise the frequencies of the signal and of the noise?
